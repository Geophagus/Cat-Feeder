# Cat-Feeder

Based on https://tttapa.github.io/ESP8266/Chap10%20-%20Simple%20Web%20Server.html

Movement of the servo arm, triggered by a website, releases a biscuit ball from a tube to feed the mog.
Next step is to trigger the servo via a button connected to another nodemcu 12e.
Adding a second servo would allow for several food balls to be used as a remote feeder.
